This collection was started by 3 school friends as a way to invest in their future but more so to keep in touch despite going into 3 very different careers in different parts of the country. The collection explores many different artists from Damien Hirst to new and upcoming artists such as LP edits. It contains a collection of prints, artist proofs, sculptures, exhibition posters and original pieces. The following portfolio outlines a brief bio of the artist in the collection alongside high quality photographs (courtesy of Ethan Windley) and particulars of each piece available. A separate price list is available upon request.
